Disclaimer ⚠️
The authors of this document take no responsibility for correctness. This project is merely here to help guide security researchers towards determining whether something is vulnerable or not, but does not guarantee accuracy. This project heavily relies on contributions from the public; therefore, proving that something is vulnerable is the security researcher and bug bounty program's sole discretion. On top of that, it is worth noting that some bug bounty programs may accept dangling DNS record reports without requiring proof of compromise.
